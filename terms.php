<p style="font-weight:600; ">4. Understanding Projects</p>
<p align="justify"> Rangeenroute is a creative platform that connects people to discover, share and boost genuine ideas.<br/><br/>
4.1 After you submit the project to Rangeenroute, our system automatically reviews your project for Project Guidelines. Once your project passes Project Guidelines, it is publicly available.</p>  
<p align="justify">
4.2 Once the project is initiated, all projects are assigned status depicting the lifeline of project. There are 5 phases of lifeline for any projects and those phases are noted as “status” of the project. Status will be shown inside the “project tab” and on the left side of video along with rating, ranking and analysis. 
</p>

 <p align="justify">4.2.1 Initiation phase: Once the user click “upload” for a project and completes       first page (project title, category, location, developer), he must click at least “save & next” to get “Initiation phase” for his project. Project will remain under initiation phase until it passes initial review for community guidelines. Single letter “I” will denote this status.</p>
<p align="justify">
4.2.2 Published phase: Once the project pass initial review for community guidelines, project goes live to public and the “published phase” starts. In this phase, project will get seed ratings and other user starts to engage with this project. Once the project gets this status, it will never ever get deleted. Single letter “P” will denote this status. </p>
<p align="justify">
4.2.3 Started up phase: The project under “published phase” turns into “Started up phase” if the project becomes eligible for funding and listed in “Fundables” tab. Single letter “S” will denoted this status.</p>
<p align="justify">
4.2.4 Developed phase: The project under “started up” phase can turn into “Developed phase” if the project gets successful funding. Then the project goes into product development. Single letter “D” will denote this status.</p>
<p align="justify">
4.2.4 Launched phase: When the product development gets completed and become available for use (sell/buy), the project enters into final phase “Launched”. All the data will be preserved and available for view, but no one can get engaged (like, comment or rate, etc.). Single letter “L” will denote this status.</p>
<p align="justify">
4.3 Your project will receive seed ratings from Project Analysis department of Rangeenroute within 24 hours of acceptance from Project Guidelines. If your project fails in seed rating procedure, your project will be removed and cannot be accessed publicly. Seed ratings are calculated using Bayesian Statistics over manually devised factors. The underlying formula, filter process and algorithms are confidential and protected under intellectual property rights of Rangeenroute. </p>
<p align="justify">
4.4 Projects that appear in “Trend” section are of high values. We calculate trending score for all projects using our algorithm defined by five factors: (a) Like (b) Rating (c) Comment (d) Route (e) Time period
<br/><br/>
4.5 You can suggest projects to others by using “Route” service.
<br/><br/>
4.6 You can view projects uploaded by your routers in “Routed” section.
<br/><br/>
4.7 You can monetize your project. Other users have to pay the monetized value to view such project while clicking “Analysis”. You will receive the money after deducting Rangeenroute fees and charges. All transactions are available in “Finance” section.
